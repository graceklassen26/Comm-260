        <p class="welcome"> <br><br><br> Hi, Look at this dope website I made! <br><br><br><br>I think it is pretty cool. <br><br>This is where you can learn all about yours truly. I have alot of opinons, and alot to say. Stick around, it will be good!<br><br>I could honestly go on about things for ever. I also talk very fast which means that I can really crank out some words. <br> I grew up in a busy and noisy family. They are most likely the reason I deleloped this special speaking talent.<br> As a journalist and hopefully one day as a lawyer, I hope to be able to take this little natural talent and spark some change. <br><br> For now it will be writing. My quick speech will hopefully translate into witty work. Combinging speech and writing could one day help me become a sucessful attorney as well.<br><br> Until then, enjoy my writing.</p>
